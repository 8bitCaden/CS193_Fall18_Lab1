## Caden's First CS193 Homework

## Things I Like about CS193

- Only have freshman in class.
- Classes that teaches and provide you with tools to suceed in computer science and Purdue's CS classes.
- Class is taught by upperclassman so they know and understand the things the underclassman they are going through.
- Like having code words being used for attendance quizzes.
